# SQLAlchemy-challenge
In this SQLAlchemy project, i used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database as the first part of my project. To receive the desired output in this part, i used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

PS: The comments throughout the projects are based on the project requirements which were as below:

- Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to your SQLite database.

- Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect your tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.

- Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.

- Perform a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis by completing the steps in the following two subsections.

- Find the most recent date in the dataset.

- Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.

- Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame, and set the index to the "date" column.

- Sort the DataFrame values by "date".

- Plot the results by using the DataFrame plot method

## Desiging my app
The second part of the project was focused on creating an app using the developed code. 
The app is available on below copied link:
